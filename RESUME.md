Software engineer with 10+ years of experience and extensive hands on practice in software architecture, infrastructure engineering (on prem and cloud), agile software development, messaging/database systems, SRE, CICD management, data intensive systems development and monitoring. 

I have experience in different platforms, but my main one is the JVM, mostly working with Kotlin, Clojure, Groovy and Java. I also have some interest in NodeJS, Go, Python and Rust.

I've contributed to different kinds of teams (product, cloud engineering, support), in different domains (E-commerce, Ads, Banking), and with different business markets (e.g. C2C, B2C). I've also worked with the US market for almost 2 years as a software consultant.

Besides the technical skills, I've also lead some teams in different companies, mentor other engineers and act on hiring pipelines, mainly focused on architecture steps.
